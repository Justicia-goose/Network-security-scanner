Simple Network Scanner
I built this to practice my Python skills while combining my electrical background with cybersecurity.

It's basically a digital version of tracing wires in a building - but for finding devices on a network!

# My Network Scanner ðŸ”Œ

Hey! I'm Ryan, an electrician transitioning into cybersecurity and software development. 

This is one of my first Python projects - it's a simple tool that scans your local network to see what devices are connected.

Why I Built This

As an electrician, I'm used to tracing wires and understanding physical systems. This project is my way of applying that same "follow the connections" thinking to digital networks.

 What It Does

- Scans your local network for connected devices
- Shows you what's on your WiFi
- Gives basic security tips from a hardware perspective

 How to Use

1. Download the `network_scanner.py` file
2. Run it with Python 3
3. It'll show you what devices are on your network

## My Background

I'm currently learning:
- Python scripting
- Network security  
- Web development
- Cybersecurity fundamentals

My electrical experience gives me a unique perspective on hardware security and understanding how systems actually work in the real world.
